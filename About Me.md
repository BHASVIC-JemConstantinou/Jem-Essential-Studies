# Jem-Essential-Studies
## About Me
### I am Jemima Constantinou, and I am currently an A-Level student at BHASVIC.
### My professional goals are to someday work in the bioinformatics field, meaning I want to be involved in the combination of technology and medical studies. I am mainly interested in the progression of research involving drug testing and disease behaviours. 
### Currently, I am working on learning the Swift language to allow me to create an app that is based around optimising the experience of using a climbing gym for my A-Level coursework. I have chosen to do this, as it is a topic I am passionate about, and from using previously existing apps for the same purpose, I have realised that I am not fully happy with any of the existing solutions. Therefore, I would like to create my own. 
### I would say that I have strong leadership and communication skills within a team, as over this year in college we have done many group projects that I have succeeded in. I have done this by keeping in regular contact with my team and helping others with any problems we have faced during the process of the project, making sure we are able to find a solution as quickly as possible. I also believe I am a good listener and I am good at compromising. I am able to take on board what others in my group are suggesting or finding issue with, and either implement their ideas or work through a solution to their problem that benefits everyone in the group as much as possible. 

## Work Showcase
### Hotel Kasyyyk
https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/Hotel-Kashyyyk.git
### Our group was tasked to create a system for a fictional hotel. This involved using procedural programming in the language C. We had to create a check in system, and dining table booking system and a check out system. I was in charge of the check out system, and my code was successful.
## Java tasks

https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/JemJavaTask3.git
https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/JemJavaTask4.git
https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/JemJavaTask5.git
## These tasks were how we learned Java in class. They involved learning about object orientated programming (OOP), encapsulation, and accessors and mutators. i completed them all with all my code being fully functional and meeting the requirements of the tasks provided.
## Pseudocode challenges
https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/PseudocodeChallenges.git
## This task involved using mine and other people's psuedocode, and turining it into a version of code that works fully to perform the task required. Whilst it was challenging using other people's code, most of the tasks were completed successfully.
